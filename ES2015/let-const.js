var PI = 3.14
const PI = 3.14

let cannot be redeclared nad is scoped by block, not function.
let can be reassigned while const cannot.

Hoisting: the compiler reads variables before code execution - accessing a var variable before a value is assigned will result in 'undefined' instead of a reference error
